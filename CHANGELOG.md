# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project
follows semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Reproducible 10,000-point, 200-group exact partition example and committed SVG.
- Configurable positive weighted-cutting scale for high-group experiments.
- Property tests for the conservative arrangement box and cutting-scale validation.

### Changed

- Replaced pairwise arrangement-vertex enumeration with an exact conservative
  bound computed from intercept span and the minimum nonzero slope gap. This
  removes the quadratic time and storage needed only to size the bounding box.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-16

### Changed

- Replaced the complete Python implementation with a C++20 library and public header.
- Preserved exact geometry with `boost::rational<boost::multiprecision::cpp_int>`.
- Replaced Python packaging with CMake build, install, and exported-target support.
- Ported the demo, SVG visualizer, benchmarks, and property tests to C++.
- Replaced Python CI with GCC/Clang CMake and CTest jobs on Linux and macOS.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-12

Added reproducible performance evidence and broader automated verification.

### Added
- Construction and exact-query benchmark with brute-force validation,
  per-query latency, speedup ratio, and optional JSON output.
- CI smoke execution of the performance benchmark.
- Tests for exact duality, boundary and axis-aligned halfplanes, multiple
  random seeds, and expected cutting failure behavior.

### Clarified
- Exactness applies to geometric coordinates and predicates; cutting scales
  derived from square roots are numeric control parameters.
- The implementation is a verified proof skeleton, not a machine-checked
  proof of the Test Set Lemma or a certified projective-plane implementation.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-10

Narrowed to the faithful theorem only.

### Removed
- The practical kd-style baseline (`practical.py`, `practical_cli.py`, the
  `practical-tree` console script, and their test) and the `examples/`
  directory that only served it. This repository is now exclusively the
  exact-arithmetic, verified proof-faithful construction. The fast,
  no-guarantee counterpart is out of scope here.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-03

Production restructure: flat scripts become an installable package.

### Changed
- **Package layout**: `src/matousek_partition_tree/` with `core.py`
  (verified construction), `practical.py` (kd-style baseline, previously
  `practical_partition_tree_2d.py`), and CLI modules. One top-level
  package, one wheel — the baseline is a submodule, not a second package.
- **`simplicial_partition()` returns `(groups, PartitionStats)`** instead
  of setting the module-level `LAST_STATS` global. `PartitionStats` is a
  frozen dataclass with tuple fields (deeply immutable). This is the
  breaking API change of this release.
- Library code logs via `logging.getLogger(__name__)`; `print()` remains
  only in the CLI modules.
- `zip(..., strict=True)` wherever equal lengths are an invariant — a
  mismatch is a bug and should raise, not be silenced.
- Type aliases (`Point`, `Line`, `Halfplane`) via `TypeAlias`.
  NamedTuple was evaluated and rejected with measurement: attribute
  access is cost-free here (exact-rational arithmetic dominates), but
  construction is ~1.25x slower and the innermost loops construct points.
- Build system: hatchling; console scripts `matousek-demo` and
  `practical-tree`; project renamed `matousek-partition-tree-demo` →
  `matousek-partition-tree`.
- CI: separate lint job (ruff check + format), tests run against the
  installed package (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`), coverage gate enforced
  (threshold set from a measured baseline, not aspiration), demos run
  via the console scripts.
- Classifier is `Development Status :: 3 - Alpha` — consistent with the
  README's own "not production" disclaimers.

### Removed
- `LAST_STATS` module global (see above).
- `tests/conftest.py` sys.path hack: tests now import the installed
  package, so a broken wheel configuration fails CI instead of being
  masked.
- `src/visualize_partition_tree_2d.py`: visualizer for the old
  flat-script CSV/JSON workflow, superseded by `visualize_matousek.py`.
- mypy configuration: it was not enforced in CI, and unenforced strict
  config rots. Type hints remain best-effort; a checked mypy job can be
  added later together with the work to make it pass.

### Fixed
- `practical` CSV loader no longer crashes on an empty file
  (`reader.fieldnames` is `None`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-02

- Practical kd-style baseline, three-panel partition figure generated
  from the verified code, crossing-number benchmark and scaling plot,
  postcondition property tests, CI, story-first README, GitHub math
  rendering fixes across all docs, typeset PDF versions of the docs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-02

- Initial verified proof-skeleton implementation of the 2D Matoušek
  Partition Theorem: exact rational arithmetic, two-level
  Chazelle–Friedman weighted cuttings with runtime verification, fixed-β
  test sets, exponential reweighting, partition tree, exact halfplane
  counting queries.
